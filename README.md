## House Price's Prediction
### Description
- This project is created to answer the question "How much you have to prepare to get the dream house?". Answer this question will help people (especially young people) to have a target that motivates to earn money. To answer this question, we use Linear Regression model and MLPRegressor (both from sklearn) with MASHVISOR data (using Selenium and API).

### Requirment
Must run in min_ds-env (from Data Science course -  Mr. Trần Trung Kiên)


### Executing Program
- Step 1: Run Get-ID.ipynb to get house IDs
- Step 2: Run Collect Data with API.ipynb to get house information 
- Step 3: Run House Price's Prediction to explore and preprocess data then build prediction model.
